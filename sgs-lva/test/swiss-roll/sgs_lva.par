NOTE1: The estimation grid and the LVA grid can be identical.
       If the grids are different the LVA GRID is resampled to the ESTIMATION GRID.
       The estimation grid affects how the multidimensional scaling occurs
       therefore, if the estimation grid is different it needs to be accounted for
       in the variogram calculation.

NOTE2: This program calls on the Boost_dijkstra.exe program to calculate the shortest paths.
       When calculating the shortest paths there is the option to connect nodes separated by more than one grid block.
       This allows for more flexible paths.  Keeping offset=1 connects each node to the nearest 8 (in 2D) and only
       allows paths with 0,45,90,135 degree increments.  Using more offsets is recommended as paths will be smoother and
       shorter but this requires more memory and may be infeasible for large 3D models

NOTE3: The Dijkstra program can be CPU intensive.  If the program is run once a file  grid_cpp.out  is
       created with all the distances between nodes and landmark points required.  Subsequent runs of the
       program can simply read in this file rather than call the Dijkstra algorithm again.
       If the number of offsets, the grid or the configuration of landmark points are changed the Dijkstra program
       MUST be run again to calculate the new UPDATED distances.

NOTE4: Retaining fewer dimensions than the max will reduce memory requirements a bit and will speed up the program.
       The most important dimensions are retained.

NOTE5: Using fewer than the maximum dimensions can speed up the program.  The most important dimensions are retained.
       This may reduce the memory requirements of the program (i.e. the kdtree) if using large grids and many landmark points.
       Set to -1 unless CPU time is an issue.  The number of dimensions searched to determine the nearest data
       can be different than the number of dimensions used in the calculation of the distance between locations.
       Using fewer data in the search can speed up the program, but may result in some error when finding close data.

NOTE6: Variogram must be positive definate in q dimensions.  The exponential variogram is recomended:
       1-spherical variogram
       2-exponenital variogram
       3-gaussian variogram
       4-power model
       5-hole effect model
