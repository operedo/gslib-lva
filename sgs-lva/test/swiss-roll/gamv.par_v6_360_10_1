NOTE1: The estimation grid and the LVA grid can be identical.
       If the grids are different the LVA GRID is resampled to the ESTIMATION GRID.
       The estimation grid affects how the multidimensional scaling occurs
       therefore, if the estimation grid is different it needs to be accounted for
       in the variogram calculation.

NOTE2: This program calls on the Boost_dijkstra.exe program to calculate the shortest paths.
       When calculating the shortest paths there is the option to connect nodes separated by more than one grid block.
       This allows for more flexible paths.  Keeping offset=1 connects each node to the nearest 8 (in 2D) and only
       allows paths with 0,45,90,135 degree increments.  Using more offsets is recommended as paths will be smoother and
       shorter but this requires more memory and may be infeasible for large 3D models

NOTE3: The Dijkstra program can be CPU intensive.  If the program is run once a file  grid_cpp.out  is
       created with all the distances between nodes and landmark points required.  Subsequent runs of the
       kriging program can simply read in this file rather than call the Dijkstra algorithm again.
       If the number of offsets, the grid or the configuration of landmark points are changed the Dijkstra program
       MUST be run again to calculate the new UPDATED distances.

NOTE4: Using fewer than the maximum dimensions can speed up the program.  The most important dimensions are retained.
       This does not reduce the memory requirements of the program, it only decreases run time.
       Set to -1 unless CPU time is an issue.
